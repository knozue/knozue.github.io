[Universal Clipboard](https://support.apple.com/kb/ph25168?locale=en_US
) is useful for this purpose when you use [a certain model of iphone, Mac, and macOS](https://blog.macsales.com/42686-a-complete-guide-to-universal-clipboard-in-macos-high-sierra). 

* Step 1. Install barcode scanner app that can copy scanned info ("QR Scanner", "QR Reader", "Qrafter" from App Store worked as of Sep 2018).
* Step 2. Scan QR code (or any codes?) and copy decoded info.
* Step 3. Paste the decoded into into your software in your computer (eg. Google Sheet, Excel, etc)
* Step 4. After reading the spread sheet with R, you can separate letters by hyphen ("-"), underscore ("_"), or other separater that can be used in base::strsplit() or tidyr::separate(). For example,
```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
strsplit("Col_sun_rep1",split="_")
library(tidyverse)
tibble(x=c("Col_sun_rep1","Col_shade_rep2")) %>% tidyr::separate(x,c("genotype","treatment","replicate"))
```

Amaizing and useful.


# Troubleshooting
(@) [Do you have frozen clipboard?](http://osxdaily.com/2018/02/02/fix-copy-paste-not-working-mac/) 
(@) Not working? Check if your devices are connected via bluethooth. It seems that WiFi network is not necessary.
(@) For Android devices, there seems [possible solution](http://www.clipbrd.com/). Even for [all OS (I haven't tested...)](https://www.pushbullet.com/apps)?
