      <description>March: Lupins started blooming and California poppies followed. March 21, 2020 This year Lupins and California poppies bloomed earlier than usual due to warm winter.

      <description>Milkweed has come back! Milkweed is one of California native plants. This spring milkweed plants returned in my backyard exactly at the same location (Fig.1), suggesting they are perennials. Milkweed plants are very important because they are the only food for precious migrating butterfly, Monarch butterfly (please read an artible in National Geographic). For most organisms milkweed is toxic because their body contain several glucosidic substances called cardenolides. Why the glucosidic substances are not toxic to Monahch butterfly?</description>

      <description>Blooming of Clarkia williamsonii; Farewell to spring? After blooming, lupine have lots of been-like seed pods (Fig. 1).
Fig. 2. Clarkia williamsonii
 Among Clarkia unguiculata plants, Clarkia williamsonii started blooming (Fig. 2) . One of closely related species, Clarkia amoena, is called farewell to spring. So as it is May, blooming of Clarkia williamsonii is likely the sign of short spring and beginning of long dry season in California.</description>

      <description>Why don&amp;rsquo;t you grow local native plants in your yards? Lawn in yards are common in USA. However, keeping lawn green needs lots of water in California. California central valley is a center of agriculture due to excellent soil quality (ref). However, weather of California central valley is Mediteranian type, which has long dry summer and wet winter (ref). Recent years California has frequent drought problems (ref), which leads me to try replacing lawn into drought resistant plants, especially local native plants, which are resistant to drought.</description>
