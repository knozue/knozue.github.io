      <description>Many small plants are growing in my yards. Are they native plants that I sprindkled? As I posted in last fall, I started watering early November 2018 and late rainy season has started after the tragic wild fire (&amp;ldquo;Butte Camp Fire&amp;rdquo;). On January 2019 I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed a couple of unfamiliar plants in my yards (Fig. 1), which should be one of native plants in California central valley pollination seed mix.</description>

      <description>Why don&amp;rsquo;t you grow local native plants in your yards? Lawn in yards are common in USA. However, keeping lawn green needs lots of water in California. California central valley is a center of agriculture due to excellent soil quality (ref). However, weather of California central valley is Mediteranian type, which has long dry summer and wet winter (ref). Recent years California has frequent drought problems (ref), which leads me to try replacing lawn into drought resistant plants, especially local native plants, which are resistant to drought.</description>
