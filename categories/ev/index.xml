      <description>Charging an electric vehicle at home Fig 1. Two 240V outlet installed in my garage today!
The world of charging an electric vehicle is totally different from gas-fueling an gasoline-powered vehicle. Similar to gas stations there are growing number of electric charger stations, such as Tesla Superchargers and EVgo. The biggest difference is that your can charge your electric vehicle at home. An easy ways is to use regular 110V outlet in your garage, which is called level 1 charging.</description>

      <description>Decarbonization and carbon sequestration  The U. S. officially notified withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on Nov 4, 2019. I am so sad to hear the news that movement toward decarbonization is essential to prevent from global warming. Please listen a high-school student (Greta Thunberg) speech on decarbonization at United Nations’ Climate Action Summit in September 2019. We should start working on decarbonization ASAP. Toward big goals of decarbonization in the world, our family started from carbon capture/sequestration project, “native plant project”, which also saved lots of precious water in California.</description>

      <description>Advantages of electric vehicles Electric vehicle (EV) became popular in California. Recently I can find more than one Tesla car during my daily commute. There are a couple of advantages of EV compared with gas powered vehicles; (1) higher cost efficiency (higher MPGe1), (2) lower maintainance cost, and (3) tax incentives and rebate (read an article in energysage.com, one in a utility company, and a site from U.S. Department of Energy).</description>
