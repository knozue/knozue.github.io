      <description>Why don&amp;rsquo;t you grow local native plants in your yards? preparation  Yolo county native sedge plants (Carex praegracilis) have been propagated in my backyard from transplants purchased from Hedgegrow farm on May 2013. They have been well grown in my backyard. Transfer 10% of plants to brick garden in front of dining (2015?) and front yard (2016 and 2017). They survived and propagated without watering. I am convinced that Carex praegracilis is good for my yards w/o any watering.</description>
