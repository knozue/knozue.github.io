      <description>Increasing self-production of electricity at home has a couple of benefits.
 Enhancing decarboniztion (only 29% of electricity from grid was produced from renewable power sources (PGE, 2019)). Increasing independency of power production.  My first solar system produced 3803 kWh per year (an average of 2015 - 2020). Switching a gas-powered car to an electric car in 2019 increased electricity comsumption 2.5 times (from (3938 to 10342 kWh). The last year (2020) I started second solar system project for my house to increase production of electricity at home.</description>

      <description>Upgrading my native plant garden Toward this rainy season I started upgrading my native plant gardens. Main goals of this project (v2) are
Completing removal of lawn from frontyard. Planting evergreen shrubs and perenials. Enlarging and remodeling backyard garden. Expanding grape tree in backyard. Labeling plants with weather resistant labeles.   Completing removal of lawn from frontyard. Fig.1 Survived lawn.
 Fig2. Replacing lawn to native plants.
 In the first project I expected spontanious disappearance of lawns from fronyard by no watering during summer.</description>

      <description>Charging an electric vehicle at home Fig 1. Two 240V outlet installed in my garage today!
The world of charging an electric vehicle is totally different from gas-fueling an gasoline-powered vehicle. Similar to gas stations there are growing number of electric charger stations, such as Tesla Superchargers and EVgo. The biggest difference is that your can charge your electric vehicle at home. An easy ways is to use regular 110V outlet in your garage, which is called level 1 charging.</description>

      <description>Decarbonization and carbon sequestration The U. S. officially notified withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on Nov 4, 2019. I am so sad to hear the news that movement toward decarbonization is essential to prevent from global warming. Please listen a high-school student (Greta Thunberg) speech on decarbonization at United Nations’ Climate Action Summit in September 2019. We should start working on decarbonization ASAP. Toward big goals of decarbonization in the world, our family started from carbon capture/sequestration project, “native plant project”, which also saved lots of precious water in California.</description>

      <description>Advantages of electric vehicles Electric vehicle (EV) became popular in California. Recently I can find more than one Tesla car during my daily commute. There are a couple of advantages of EV compared with gas powered vehicles; (1) higher cost efficiency (higher MPGe1), (2) lower maintainance cost, and (3) tax incentives and rebate (read an article in energysage.com, one in a utility company, and a site from U.S. Department of Energy).</description>
