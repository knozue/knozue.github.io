      <description>More learning on Regenerative Agriculture I have to mention an important book published this summer on regenerative agriculture, written by Helen Atthowe. titled The Ecological Farm. From a my favorite podcast on regenerative agriculure, called “Regenerative Agriculturee Podcast” by John Kemp, a host John Kemp interviewed Helen in July 6th episode. I learned taht Helen has been practicing regenerative agriculture for years in her three farms. In this episode I was so impressed that Helen’s way of regenerating soil uses living plant mulch instead of animal manure, which is suitable to small farms in Japan (I think).</description>

      <description>Regenerative Agriculture, sustainable firming we should pursue? Regenerative agriculture (or Carbon farming) is what I’ve been looking for. I remember that I read “The One-Straw Revolution: An Introduction to Natural Farming” by Masanobu Fukuoka (in Japanse) many times in a university library when I was undergraduate student (35 years ago!). Since then I’ve been working on plant molecular biology, stepping on data science those days. The last year my favorite news podcast handled the regerative agriculture, which lead me to read “Dirt to Soil” (Gabe Brown), who were practicing regenerative agriculture 20 years.</description>
