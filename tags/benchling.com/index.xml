      <description>RNAseq is a powerful tool for transcriptome analysis. It is also useful for genotyping (for example, 1). Here I demonstrated an example of confirmation of genotype used for RNAseq. There are some unavoidable errors due to unexpected mistakes in many steps (eg. contamination of seeds, contamination of samples, pipetting errors during library preparation, rotation of plates, etc.). Therefore confirmation of genotype using RNAseq data is useful for quality control of samples used 2.</description>

      <description>Here I would like to start describe briefly how I manage my work and personal projects.
How to make your experiments reproducible As scientists we need to convince others that your results are not by chance. Here are four advices I want to emphasize here.
 Keep all records on your lab notebook presicely that should be easy to understand. Simplify methods of data input to reduce errors. Have clear and precise data analysis.</description>
