      <description>Draft for a new post Annotating sequences is critical for making a construct in molecular biology. Benchling.com is a powerful tool for automating the annotation process. This example explains how to label “2x35S promoter” region in sequences of interest.
step1: Before adding 2x35S promoter benchling.com plasmid annotation (step1)
  step2: Exporting 2x25S promoter feature info (sequences) from known annotated sequence From pMDC32 vector (ref), which has been imported into benchling.</description>
