      <description>Increasing self-production of electricity at home has a couple of benefits.
 Enhancing decarboniztion (only 29% of electricity from grid was produced from renewable power sources (PGE, 2019)). Increasing independency of power production.  My first solar system produced 3803 kWh per year (an average of 2015 - 2020). Switching a gas-powered car to an electric car in 2019 increased electricity comsumption 2.5 times (from (3938 to 10342 kWh). The last year (2020) I started second solar system project for my house to increase production of electricity at home.</description>
