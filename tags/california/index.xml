      <description>March: Lupins started blooming and California poppies followed. March 21, 2020 This year Lupins and California poppies bloomed earlier than usual due to warm winter. During shelter-in place order many sidewalkers enjoyed our front yard. Some of them took pictures of plants, and others took California poppy plants and planted them to their front yards. As expected those plants were died. I would like to point out that taking s</description>

      <description>Charging an electric vehicle at home Fig 1. Two 240V outlet installed in my garage today!
The world of charging an electric vehicle is totally different from gas-fueling an gasoline-powered vehicle. Similar to gas stations there are growing number of electric charger stations, such as Tesla Superchargers and EVgo. The biggest difference is that your can charge your electric vehicle at home. An easy ways is to use regular 110V outlet in your garage, which is called level 1 charging.</description>

      <description>Decarbonization and carbon sequestration  The U. S. officially notified withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on Nov 4, 2019. I am so sad to hear the news that movement toward decarbonization is essential to prevent from global warming. Please listen a high-school student (Greta Thunberg) speech on decarbonization at United Nations’ Climate Action Summit in September 2019. We should start working on decarbonization ASAP. Toward big goals of decarbonization in the world, our family started from carbon capture/sequestration project, “native plant project”, which also saved lots of precious water in California.</description>

      <description>Milkweed has come back! Milkweed is one of California native plants. This spring milkweed plants returned in my backyard exactly at the same location (Fig.1), suggesting they are perennials. Milkweed plants are very important because they are the only food for precious migrating butterfly, Monarch butterfly (please read an artible in National Geographic). For most organisms milkweed is toxic because their body contain several glucosidic substances called cardenolides. Why the glucosidic substances are not toxic to Monahch butterfly?</description>

      <description>Blooming of Clarkia williamsonii; Farewell to spring? After blooming, lupine have lots of been-like seed pods (Fig. 1).
Fig. 2. Clarkia williamsonii blooming
 Among Clarkia unguiculata plants, Clarkia williamsonii started blooming (Fig. 2) . One of closely related species, Clarkia amoena, is called farewell to spring. So as it is May, blooming of Clarkia williamsonii is likely the sign of short spring and beginning of long dry season in California.</description>

      <description>Advantages of electric vehicles Electric vehicle (EV) became popular in California. Recently I can find more than one Tesla car during my daily commute. There are a couple of advantages of EV compared with gas powered vehicles; (1) higher cost efficiency (higher MPGe1), (2) lower maintainance cost, and (3) tax incentives and rebate (read an article in energysage.com, one in a utility company, and a site from U.S. Department of Energy).</description>

      <description>Many small plants are growing in my yards. Are they native plants that I sprindkled? As I posted in last fall, I started watering early November 2018 and late rainy season has started after the tragic wild fire (&amp;ldquo;Butte Camp Fire&amp;rdquo;). On January 2019 I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed a couple of unfamiliar plants in my yards (Fig. 1), which should be one of native plants in California central valley pollination seed mix.</description>

      <description>Why don&amp;rsquo;t you grow local native plants in your yards? Lawn in yards are common in USA. However, keeping lawn green needs lots of water in California. California central valley is a center of agriculture due to excellent soil quality (ref). However, weather of California central valley is Mediteranian type, which has long dry summer and wet winter (ref). Recent years California has frequent drought problems (ref), which leads me to try replacing lawn into drought resistant plants, especially local native plants, which are resistant to drought.</description>
